FitRPG gamifies fitness. It is a mobile app created by Amira Anuar, Matt Gutierrez, and Conor Fennel at Hack Reactor. FitRPG transforms a Fitbit user's data into a character that can fight friends, battle bosses, and go on quests using the steps, distance, and sleep tracked by the Fitbit. The game logic seeks to motivate users to stay fit and challenge themselves to go that extra mile in order to win a battle or complete a quest.
